The IP address 192.168.1.1 and the address http://192.168.1.1 are used to enter the default WiFi router settings. To enter the router, the so-called Personal Account, you need to enter the username and password admin admin. In TP-Link routers, the entrance is carried out at the addresses tplinklogin.net or tplinkwifi.net.

## INPUT: 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.0.1 instruction
How to get to settings via 192.168.1.1 admin / admin?
To change the parameters of any wireless router, you do NOT need to install additional software or drivers. The device can be configured on any computer or laptop, phone or tablet. Some router models are configured only with a network cable. But most modern routers can be configured wirelessly over Wi-Fi.

Therefore, entering 192.168.1.1 and configuring the router is possible: both with and without a network cable - using Wi-Fi technology. This does not change the general order of entry. An Internet connection is not required.

Login and setup at http://192.168.1.1:
Open any internet browser
Enter http://192.168.1.1 in the address bar
Login to 192.168.1.1 by admin admin
When the authorization window appears, specify the username and password - admin admin or those indicated on the sticker at the bottom of the router

 
Explanations:

In the example, Yandex was used. Browser, but any will do (Chrome, Safari, Mozilla Firefox ..). Your router's IP may differ from 192.168.1.1 (see table below). The most popular is 192.168.1.1 (Zyxel, TP-Link, Sagemcom, Asus, Tenda), the second most popular is 192.168.0.1 (D-Link, Netgear). It is convenient to use the following addresses tplinklogin.net and tplinkwifi.net to configure TP-Link. But in my case, http://192.168.1.1 is suitable. The username and password admin admin may also not be suitable, more on this here.
